The goal of this assignment is to implement the Collatz sequence explorer.
The initial starting value for the sequence will be obtained from the user via the
buttons on the LCD Shield (as described in Specifications below). Upon user
confirmation, the device should display the initial value, whatever it is, and its
count of 0 at the designated locations on LCD. After a short time-delay, the
device will advance to the next value and display its corresponding count of
1. The value and its count will continue advancing with a predetermined timedelay between them until the value reaches 1, at which point the last value
and its count will remain on the screen until the user selects another value.
The time-delay period will be chosen by the user, as described in Specifications
below.
While the Collatz sequence is advancing on the screen, the user should be able
to continue to interact with the input prompt using the LCD shield buttons.
At any time, when the user changes the speed setting, the time-delay should
be adjusted accordingly and immediately. Similarly, when the user changes the
starting value and confirms the selection, immediately upon confirmation, the
sequence display will update with the new starting value and start advancing
from there.
